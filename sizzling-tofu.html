        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe requires very few 
            and simple ingredients. Firm 
            tofu, bell peppers, garlic, 
            onions, mayonnaise, and 
            oyster sauce is actually 
            all you need. But if you 
            like, you can add some chilis 
            to give it an added kick.</p>
        <quotation>I am used to frying tofu as a whole block and just cutting it once it is fried, this is how it is done usually, well in our house at least. It is easier and faster that way, especially if you are gonna fry a lot of tofu.</quotation>
