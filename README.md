This project is about creating an HTML website about recipes.

By the end of this project, the user (me) must have demonstrated the following:
- Self-awareness
- Familiarity with HTML Boilerplate
- Proper use of tags, elements, and attributes

And if you have trouble, don't worry - it's part of the process. Keep on going!
